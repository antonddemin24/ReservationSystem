# Reservation system

## Introduction

The program saves information about reservations into a calendar and marks the chosen resources as reserved for that time. When making a reservation causes a conflict (the resource has already been reserved), the reservation doesnâ€™t go through. The program adds relevant information on the customer to each reservation. The program can be used to check the reservations on a given point of time and to print out information on reservations within a time interval determined by the user.
